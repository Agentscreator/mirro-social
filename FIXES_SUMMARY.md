# Fixes Applied

## 1. ✅ Fixed "Thinking" text color issue
- **File**: `components/typing-animation.tsx`
- **Change**: Changed the gradient colors from `sky-500/600/700` to `blue-500/600/700` to make the "Thinking" text blue instead of light blue
- **Lines**: Updated both the text gradient and dots color

## 2. ✅ Enhanced automatic group creation error handling
- **File**: `components/new-post/NewPostCreator.tsx`
- **Change**: Added better error handling and user feedback for group creation failures
- **Improvement**: Now shows specific error messages to users when group creation fails

## 3. ⚠️ Group Statuses → Community Statuses
- **Status**: Could not locate "Group Statuses" text in the codebase
- **Action needed**: Please specify where this text appears (navigation, menu, component name, etc.)

## 4. ✅ Fixed media upload in messages
- **File**: `components/messages/MessageComposer.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added file upload functionality with progress indicator
  - Added attachment preview with remove option
  - Enhanced the interface to support multiple file types (images, videos, audio, documents)
  - Integrated with existing `/api/messages/upload` endpoint
  - Updated send button to work with attachments

## 5. ✅ Enhanced notification read status handling
- **File**: `components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added automatic refresh after marking notifications as read
  - Added error handling with fallback refresh
  - Improved synchronization with server state

## 6. ✅ Fixed user ordering on discover page
- **File**: `app/(authenticated)/discover/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Users with embeddings (Tier 1 & 2) now appear before users without embeddings (Tier 3)
  - Maintained randomization within each tier to prevent staleness
  - Improved sorting algorithm to prioritize by tier first, then by score

## 7. ✅ Fixed mobile swipe navigation positioning
- **File**: `app/(authenticated)/discover/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Moved "← Swipe or tap to explore →" text above the user card instead of below
  - Added touch event handlers to the user card for swipe functionality
  - Improved text color for better visibility (`text-gray-400`)

## API Endpoints Verified
- ✅ `/api/posts/[id]/create-group` - Working properly
- ✅ `/api/messages/upload` - Working properly for media uploads
- ✅ `/api/notifications` - PUT method for marking as read

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test the discover page to verify "Thinking" text is now blue
2. Test post creation with auto-group creation enabled
3. Test media upload in messages (images, videos, documents)
4. Test notification marking as read and verify they disappear
5. Test discover page user ordering (users with embeddings should appear first)
6. Test mobile swipe navigation on discover page

## Notes
- The "Group Statuses" → "Community Statuses" change could not be completed as the text was not found in the codebase
- All other requested fixes have been implemented
- Media upload now supports images, videos, audio, and documents
- User ordering now properly prioritizes users with AI embeddings
