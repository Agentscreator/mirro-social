# Debugging Steps for Media Upload and Notifications

## Issues to Fix:
1. ❌ Media upload fails in messages and stories
2. ❌ Mark notifications as read doesn't work
3. ❌ Automatic group creation in posts doesn't create messaging groups

## Debugging Steps:

### 1. Media Upload Issue
- ✅ MessageComposer has attachment support
- ✅ SimpleMessageComposer has file upload functionality  
- ✅ useRealtimeMessages hook supports attachments
- ✅ Messages API supports attachment fields
- ✅ Database schema has attachment fields
- ❓ Need to test actual upload flow

### 2. Notifications Issue
- ✅ NotificationBell component calls markAsRead
- ✅ Notifications API has PUT method for marking as read
- ✅ Database schema has isRead field
- ❓ Need to check if API is actually updating the database

### 3. Group Creation Issue
- ✅ NewPostCreator sends autoAcceptInvites and groupName
- ✅ Posts API has group creation logic (but commented out)
- ✅ create-group API endpoint exists
- ❓ Need to enable group creation in posts API
